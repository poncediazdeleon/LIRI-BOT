# LIRI-BOT
LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.


Before You Begin


LIRI will search Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies.
Make a new GitHub repository called liri-node-app and clone it to your computer.
